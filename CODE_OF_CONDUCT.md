# Code of Conduct

Velum is committed to a welcoming and harassment-free experience for everyone. All contributors, maintainers, and community members are expected to follow these rules whenever they interact in repositories, issue trackers, chat rooms, or any other project space.

## Expected behavior

- Be respectful and inclusive. Assume good intent and treat people as collaborators.
- Share constructive feedback. Critique ideas, not people.
- Keep conversations technical. Move off-topic or sensitive discussions to private channels.
- Respect differing skill levels and backgrounds.

## Unacceptable behavior

- Harassment, discrimination, or personal attacks.
- Publishing others' private information without consent.
- Sustained disruption of discussions or reviews.
- Any behavior that violates applicable laws or contracts.

## Reporting

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior:

1. Collect as much context as possible (links, screenshots, commit hashes, timestamps).
2. Email `founders@velum-labs.com` with the subject `Code of Conduct`.
3. The core maintainers will acknowledge within three business days and keep all reports confidential.

Consequences may include warnings, PR rejections, temporary bans, or permanent removal from the community, depending on severity.
