# Security Policy

We take the safety of Firewall users seriously and appreciate coordinated disclosure.

## Supported versions

Only the latest release of `@velum/firewall` receives security updates. If you depend on the library in production, plan to stay current with tagged releases.

## Reporting a vulnerability

1. Email `founders@velum-labs.com` with the subject `Vulnerability Report: @velum/firewall`.
2. Include:
   - A clear description of the issue and impact.
   - Reproduction steps or proof-of-concept code.
   - Any mitigation ideas you have already tried.
   - Whether the issue has been disclosed elsewhere.
3. Encrypt your message if you prefer; request our PGP key in the initial email if you need it.

## What to expect

- We acknowledge new reports within three business days.
- Maintainers will collaborate with you on fixes and timelines. Please keep reports confidential until a patch is released.
- When we publish a fix, we credit reporters (unless you request anonymity) and document the issue in the CHANGELOG or release notes.

Thank you for helping keep the Velum ecosystem secure.
